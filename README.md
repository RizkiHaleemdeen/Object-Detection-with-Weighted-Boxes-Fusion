01. Clone this repository 
02. To Run the simple web interface built through streamlit on your local server run the following command on your terminal
  
  streamlit run app.py
 Notes:
 Results are not promising yet for the weighted boxes fusion but i believe with some parameter tuning and using this ensembling method for a specific task oriented detection the results could be improved
